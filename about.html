  <br/>  This is a specification for an "Events" system. "Events" covers a wide functionality and many different event contexs. From an engineering perspective "Events" can be seen as functionality primitive meaning something that happens attached to a time frame. For users events could be anything from an item in a personal schedule, something that happened in their life. By using this system various users can login and participate in different events. It eases registration process so it's a user friendly product.
   <br>
   <br>
  <br/>  In this system there were many events around the world is organized for business purpose and study purpose. We purpose the requirements for a simples like presentations, meetings, conferences and seminars.
   <br>
   <br>
 <br/>  Now a question might be arising why event management? And what the new things we are going to do in event management.
   <br>
   <br>

<br/>   When the event is organized, we came to know about it by marketing elements like advertisement, newspaper, TV ads., and the main part "flyers"
   <br>
   <br>
  <br/>  From the keyword flyers, we struck to an idea. And that was why we don't make a system which makes online flyers. 
   <br>
   <br>
  <br/>  So we thought that a students get registered in an app. With their details and interests area. And at other part the one who organizes events will fill his details in a form which will include all the details of seminar, guest speaker, time, date, day, and other required information.
   <br>
   <br>
  <br/>   Now after a student or event manager fill their particular form, our system will generate e-flyer. Now the question again arises what to do with flyer?
    <br>
   <br>
  <br/>   With the flyer from event manager side, students will come to know about the topics related to them and they will register themselves with the link provided in the flyer. And the flyer from student side, event manager will come to know about the students interested in the event he has organized.  So that he will send them all the updates and notification to the students or participants. 
    <br>
   <br>
   <br/> So thus our product is going to work....!!!
